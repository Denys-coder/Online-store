refactoring:
    1. move code from controllers into service classes
    2. make html receive and respond item specs as map in place of two list (admin controller)

minor fixes:
    1. make item comply specs order (store as blob or as two lists or wrap spec in class)
    3. comply item images order when displaying them (store them as list)
    4. make "Choose an image file" and "Choose images" buttons display on a one line (/add-item, /update-item)

new features
    2. display item's images as carousel when creating/updating item
