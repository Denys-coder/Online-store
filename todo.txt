// FIX


// REFACTOR
• use @Named + qualifiedBy vs expression in mappers
• if during validation in the service it is possible to check several errors at the same time and correct several at the same time, then do this


// IMPLEMENT
• add all kinds of tests (at least JUnit and Mockito)
• add logging
• use Spring Boot AOP
• add pagination
• make Order == cart, add boolean order.fulfilled, add CartItem
• add pagination for all endpoints that can return a lot of data
• share and add Postman collection
• use 3-party apis: Stripe, SendGrid API, EasyPost, Shippo, CurrencyLayer, Open Exchange Rates
• add reset password feature
• add email confirmation feature
• save session before restarting server
• add creation date field in the order class
• save image mime type in database not to calculate it on each request
• don't delete an item, but flag it as deleted
