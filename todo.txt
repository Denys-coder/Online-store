// FIX
• make operations that depend on each other or put a database into inconsistent state transactional
• always send user from a database, using user id from security context


// REFACTOR
• delegate controller parameter validation to service/util class methods
• move code from controllers into service or util methods
• extract similar logic from GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE endpoints
• swap all deprecated methods (getReference(), etc)
• refactor usage of Optional class


// IMPLEMENT
• add all kinds of tests (at least JUnit and Mockito)
• add logging
• use Spring Boot AOP
• make Order == cart, add boolean order.fulfilled, add CartItem
• add pagination for all endpoints that can return a lot of data
• share and add Postman collection
• use 3-party apis: Stripe, SendGrid API, EasyPost, Shippo, CurrencyLayer, Open Exchange Rates
• add reset password feature
• add email confirmation feature
• save session before restarting server
• add creation date field in the order class
• save image mime type in database not to calculate it on each request
